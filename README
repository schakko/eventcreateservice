eventcreateservice.php - SOAP service for Windows Event log

eventcreateservice.php (ECS) is a  simple SOAP service which uses eventcreatef.exe by Florian Weinert 
(http://prunkster.ecw.de/2010/04/12/eventcreatef-exe-eine-erganzung-zu-eventcreate-exe/).
Every incoming SOAP message will be passed through to eventcreatef.exe which will write the log 
message to a Windows 2003/XP event log. With ECS and eventcreatef.exe you can log any event to a an 
eventlog of central Windows machine without Syslogd running.

Workflow
=======
